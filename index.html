            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Dereck Bélanger and I am a first year computer science student.
                I am 20 years old and I study at Laval University in Québec Canada. I started coding after 
                giving myself the challenge to complete Harvard's CS50 course and discovered a passion for
                coding because of the endless possibilities and the creativity. What I've discovered since then,
                is a way to test myself with the constant evolution of the tech world on top of the fun there is 
                at creating stuff like web pages, apps and more
            </p>

                <h3>Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)</h3>
                <h4>Harvard Certification</h4>
                <p>This course was hard for me, I started with no knowldege of coding whatsoever but after
                    many months of grinding and juggling between work, school and extracurricular work, I managed
                    to get in depth skills in C, python, SQL and much more. Since CS50 is project oriented, I also 
                    built myself a small portfolio while learning.
                </p>

                <h3>Introduction to Cyber Security (CS50S)</h3>
                <h4>Harvard Certification</h4>
                <p>In this course, I learnt the basics of cybersecurity. How to secure data, hashing, salts
                industry standards regarding levels of security and more. This has helped me be more professionnal
                and safe in my practices when building software.
